# classification-challenge

This code is to develop a supervised machine learning (ML) model that will accurately detect spam emails so it can filter them out of its customers' inboxes. The dataset used contains information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam.

The code creates two classification models to fit the provided data, and evaluate which model is more accurate at detecting spam.
